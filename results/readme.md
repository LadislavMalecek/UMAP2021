# Results evaluation scripts:
- compute_metrics_aggregatedResults.py: calculates aggregated results (utilized in uniform scenario)
- compute_metrics_rawResults.py: calculates raw results per group member (necessary for significance analysis)
- compute_metrics_weightedProportionality.py: calculates results for the weighted scenario (correlation an MAE between the expected and received proportions of utility metric)
- compute_metrics_longTerm.py: calculates results of the long-term scenario (i.e., considers mean values over all evaluated folds)
